# 🍫 Chocolate Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📋 Overview
This project features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard built to analyze the year-long sales performance of a chocolate company. It tracks key metrics like sales, profit, boxes sold, product trends, regional performance, and salesperson efficiency. The dashboard supports data-driven decisions by making patterns, outliers, and opportunities easy to identify.

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 📈 Sales & Profit Trends
Sales fluctuated over the year, with strong growth in November and a noticeable dip in early Q3. Profit margins remain healthy across most regions and products.

### 🌍 Region-Wise Performance
Australia and India lead in sales volume. Some regions show growth potential with targeted effort.

### 🧑‍💼 Salesperson Performance
Top reps like Camilla and Gigi consistently outperform in both volume and profit. Visual benchmarks help quickly spot low-performing reps.

### 🍫 Product Category Breakdown
Bars dominate in both boxes sold and revenue share, followed by Bites. “Other” category shows seasonal spikes.

Histogram analysis reveals high volume in mid-size orders (200–400 boxes), helping optimize logistics and inventory planning.
